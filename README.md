# google-big-query-analytics
Storing analytics event data with Google Big Query. The purpose of this application is to explore alternate ways to expose required analytics data to be sent to a user's analytics database. In this case, we're using Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics, and Google BigQuery to help facilitate our data pipeline. Although not quite practical from a cost perspective, this application utilizes Google BigQuery to store the event data, which is then retrieved on every relevant event hit from the client.

The events get stored as their own rows within an analytics specific table inside BigQuery, each row containing a unique ID. The same unique IDs are then taken and applied to the markup of your web application in the form of data attributes, classes, or ids. When a user selects an element, a http post request, containing the element's analytics ID, is sent to a proxy express.js server. The proxy server, similar to how server-side tagging works in GTM, then sends another request to BigQuery and fetches the associated ID's data from the analytics table and returns the data back to the proxy then back to the client which then get's injected into the GTM client dataLayer and passed along to Google Analytics.
